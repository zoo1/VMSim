# VMSim
Virtual Memory replacement algorithm simulator written in python.

The following project simulates virtual memory by taking an input of address refferences and a selected replacement algorithm.
The output is the number of page faults, writes to disk, and total memory accesses.

The supported replacement algorithms are:
* Optimal
* Clock
* Aging
* Least Recently Used
